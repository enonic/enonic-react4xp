# MAIN REACT4XP OPTIONAL SETTINGS
#
# Copy this to your local react4xp project root to use it, change or comment in/out values if needed.
#
# NOTE: These settings need to be read and used by react4xp/buildComponents to build a constants file under /build/. In this package
#       (react4xp), there is a react4xp.gradle that takes care of that. Without those steps these settings won't have any effect.
#
#       What to do? One of these:
#       - Manual alternative: use react4xp.gradle as a template to write your own (adapted?) gradle setup in your
#             project, that reads these variables and inserts them into buildconstants the same way. And make sure to
#             update your own setup as needed, whenever you update react4xp from NPM.
#       - Auto-updated alternative: add to your build.gradle: `apply from: "node_modules/@enonic/react4xp/react4xp.gradle"`. This
#             will make sure that you're always using the react4xp build setup that comes with the version of react4xp
#             you're using. However, then you can't just run `enonic project deploy` without running `npm install` first, since
#             the build now depends on an NPM package.
#       - Auto-updated alternative, with NPM workaround: take a look at build.gradle in the react4xp starter
#             (https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp/blob/master/build.gradle) and how it checks for whether
#             react4xp.gradle exists (and runs `npm install` if not) before applying it.

# buildEnv sets the build mode:
#   - 'production' yields compact output and will overwrite existing symlinks under node_modules. If needed, they must be rebuilt.
#   - 'development' enables more verbose terminal output during build,
#   - 'development' keeps compiled code more readable,
#   - 'development' controls npmInstall.gradle, and instructs it to run the nsiInstall task instead of npmInstall.
#                   NsiInstall uses node-safe-install to wrap "npm install" in order to preserve existing symlinks under node_modules.
# Default build mode is 'production', but can be overridden with CLI arg: -Pdev or -Pdevelopment -Pdev when running gradle.
# Or uncomment the following line to lock development build mode:
#
# buildEnv = development



####################################   ENTRIES AND CHUNKING:

# If nothing is added below, this is the default behaviour:
#   - Default entry source folder is /site/, that is: src/main/resources/site/ and its subfolders.
#   - Everything under react4xp root folder (src/main/resources/react4xp/) will be considered chunks and will
#       be bundled by webpack into a single dependency imported by webpack: react4xp.<contenthash>.js
#   - Everything under the react4xp root folder (src/main/resources/react4xp/) will be considered non-entries:
#       added files here can be imported by react4xp entries, but otherwise unreachable from react4xp.
#   - Default entryExtensions (file extensions to look for when finding entries under OTHER entryDirs than /site/) are:
#       jsx, js, tsx, ts, es6, es


# chunkDirs are folder names where importable, non-entry code is kept. Comma-separated list of folder names, relative
#       to src/main/resources/react4xp/. Each folder added here will be bundled by webpack into a separate dependency
#       chunk with the same name as the folder, and a hash: <foldername>.<contenthash>.js. This is good for grouping
#       sets of dependencies that belong together, or will frequently be requested from the client together in some parts
#       of a web page but not others, etc. The react4xp root (src/main/resources/react4xp/) is the standard chunk 'react4xp',
#       but you can add subfolders here to bundle them (and their subfolders) in separate chunks. Or you can add relative
#       paths to the react4xp root to imported dependency code from elsewhere. Don't overlap with entryDirs or /site/.
chunkDirs =


# entryDirs are additional folder names where webpack will look for entry files. Comma-separated list of folder names,
#       relative to src/main/resources/react4xp/. By default, react4xp instructs webpack to look for entries under
#       src/main/resources/site/ (and in the react4xp-templates package). Added folders here will be kept out of bundled
#       dependency chunks (take care to avoid directory overlaps with chunkDirs) and treated separately. Files in
#       them will be compiled into react4xp entries, which most importantly get a jsxPath (relative to their entryDir, not
#       relative to /react4xp/) and therefore are available to react4xp.
#       overrideComponentWebpack file (see above).
#
#       For compatibility with earlier versions of react4xp, add _entries here.
entryDirs =


# entryExtensions are filename extensions of files (comma-separated list) below the entryDirs folders that webpack should
#       look for and turn into entries. NOTE that this doesn't apply to the default entry-folder src/main/resources/site/
#       (or the react4xp-templates package), where ONLY .jsx (and .tsx) files can be entries. This is to avoid mixups with
#       XP controllers etc, which can be .js or .es6. Default value if not changed is jsx,js,tsx,ts,es6,es. Also note that
#       tsx/ts files are NOT supported out of the box. Rules for typescript compilation must be added in your own
# entryExtensions =
